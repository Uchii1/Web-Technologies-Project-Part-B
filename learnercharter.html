<h1> Our Learner Charter </h1>
  <p> The Dynamic Tutor learner charter sets out our responsibilities towards our learners during our programmes,
  and what we expect from our learners in turn.
  Through our learner charter, we aim to provide a conducive learning environment and retain high student engagement.
  </p>

<h2 class="roll-text"> Our Commitment to Our Learners </h2>
  <p> At Dynamic Tutors, our promise is to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li> Provide a safe and focused environment for learning  </li>
    <li> Ensure students are matched to tutors with competencies tailored to each learner's needs</li>
    <li> Help our students set clear objectives for their progress </li>
    <li> Maintain our student's confidentiality and uphold our safeguarding policy </li>
    <li> Handle any safeguarding concerns raised with care according to relevant regulations and our published policy  </li>
    <li> Provide signposting to further support as appropriate </li>
  </ul>


<h2 class="roll-text-right">  Our Expectations of Our Learners </h2>
  <p>We expect our learners to: </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Show due respect for tutors, facilitators and other learners. </li>
    <li> Attend sessions well prepared, with all books, materials and stationery required. </li>
    <li> Attend sessions on time, and stay physically present and mentally engaged until the end of the session. </li>
    <li> Ask for help when needed, and remain open to learning and growth. </li>
    <li> Respect the privacy and confidentiality of other learners. </li>
    <li> Refrain from using their mobile phones during sessions, except in an emergency or where expressly permitted by a tutor or facilitator </li>
