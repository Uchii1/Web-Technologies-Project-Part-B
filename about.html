<h2> About Us </h2>
 <p> For 20 years, Dynamic Tutors has been aiding students from lower-income and disadvantaged backgrounds, offering free programmes 
  and tutoring to boost student performance and improve examination outcomes. 
 Our work is supported by a team of dedicated volunteers, which includes university students from a wide range of backgrounds. </p>

  <summary> <strong> What are the academic requirements to volunteer as a tutor?</strong>  </summary>
  <p> To tutor in our A-level programmes, you will require at least an B in the chosen subject at A-level or to be studying the subject at University. 
   <br> For potential GCSE level tutors, we require you to meet either of the above requirements, or to have achieved at least a grade 8 in the subject at GCSE. </p>
</details> </p>

 <p><details> 
  <summary> <strong> What is the time commitment for volunteers? </strong>   </summary>
  <p> Our tutors typically spend one hour a week in preparation, and about two hours weekly in sessions during our programmes.
    Depending on your programme and subject, this might differ slightly. </p>
